# Formora — Build Log

A running record of what's actually been built, in plain language. Updated as each feature/module ships, starting from Phase 1 (see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the plan; this file records what actually happened).

Each entry: what was done, what it enables, anything worth remembering about how it works.

## Phase 1 — `@hardikrastogi/core` schema & validation engine

**What was built:**
- `FormDefinition` schema (`src/schema/form-definition.ts`) — the blueprint object for a form: `fields`, `layout` (12-column grid), `theme` (design tokens), `logic` (conditional visibility + calculated fields), plus metadata (`id`, `name`, `schemaVersion`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
- `FormSubmission` schema (`src/schema/form-submission.ts`) — `{ formId, schemaVersion, answers, meta }`, what gets created when a respondent submits a form.
- Field-type plugin interface + registry (`src/plugin.ts`) — the `{ type, schema, defaultProps, Editor, Renderer, validate }` contract every field type (text, KYC, etc.) will implement later. Kept framework-agnostic (no React import) so `core` stays usable outside React.
- Validation engine (`src/validation.ts`) — `validateSubmission(definition, answers)` checks required fields and per-field rules (minLength/maxLength/min/max/pattern), returns `{ success, errors }` with field-level messages.
- Schema versioning helpers (`src/versioning.ts`) — `isSubmissionCurrent` and `bumpSchemaVersion`, the mechanism that lets an old submission stay valid even after its form has since changed.
- Structural safety checks built into `FormDefinitionSchema` itself: rejects duplicate field IDs, layout rows whose column spans exceed 12, layout/logic referencing a field ID that doesn't exist.
- 10 Vitest unit tests covering both the schema (`form-definition.test.ts`) and the validation engine (`validation.test.ts`) — all passing.

**What this enables:** any consumer (the future renderer, builder, or a hand-written test) can now construct a `FormDefinition`, validate it structurally, and validate a set of answers against it — with zero UI involved.

**Published:** `@hardikrastogi/core@0.1.0` is live on npm.
